Question
========

The San Antonio Chamber of Commerce is conducting an economic 
impact study of the tourism industry on the local economy. 
For this purpose, the daily expenses of summer tourists are anlyzed. 
A survey with $`r n`$ tourists is conducted. It shows that the
tourists spend on average $`r Mean`$ dollars. The sample standard 
deviation is $`r sd`$.

Calculate the Margin of Error around the mean estimate using a $`r conf'$% 
confidence level. 

Solution
========

The $95\%$ confidence interval for the average expenses $\mu$ is
given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&   & \left[\bar{y} \, - \, 1.96\sqrt{\frac{s_{n-1}^2}{n}}, \; 
  \bar{y} \, + \, 1.96\sqrt{\frac{s_{n-1}^2}{n}}\right] \\
& = & \left[ `r Mean` \, - \, 1.96\sqrt{\frac{`r Var`}{`r n`}}, \;
             `r Mean` \, + \, 1.96\sqrt{\frac{`r Var`}{`r n`}}\right] \\
& = & \left[`r LB`, \, `r UB`\right].
\end{aligned}
$$
